This script is a simple, naive, and rough mechanism to interact with the Knol Redirect API application: https://knol-redirects.appspot.com/_ah/api/redirects/v0.1/

1. Get an OAuth2 key with the correct scope and user with correct permissions here (or extend this script using the Google library) 
    1.1 https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/
        1.1.1 Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/knol
    1.2 OR https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#libraries
2. Add the correct OAuth2 key to the script (hard-coded). 
3. Store the data in a data.csv file with fields:
    3.1 ID-prefix, ID-suffix, New URL

4. Run with python, or make the script executable and run it that way.
    4.1 $ python redirect.py
    4.2 $ chmod +x redirect.py
        $ ./redirect.py
